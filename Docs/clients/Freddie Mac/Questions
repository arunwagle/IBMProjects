·         What data science tools are available?

                IBM Data Science experience (DSX)
                    - Create Notebooks in Scala, Python or R
                    - Import notebooks directly from GIT
                    - Integrate with Data Sources - Currently supports IBM SWIFT Object Storage.
                    - Collaborate with other members in the team
                    - Share notebooks on Social media
                    - Connect to Cloud databases like DASHDB, Postgres and many others
                    - Connect to external data services like Postgres on Compose, SoftLayer Object Storage, Service On Premises, Amazon S3 etc
                    - Uses IBM Analytics for Apache Spark on IBM Bluemix behind the scenes for data processing.
                    - Ability to create new Jupyter Notebooks for different use cases matching your needs
                    - Integrated with RStudio
                    - Search for existing Notebooks from a huge repository to get started quickly.
                    - Ability to change kernel(Scala, Python or R kernel) on the fly. These are actual runtimes to run notebooks
                    - Data Science Experience also leverages Spark and SystemML, which is the machine learning optimizer that IBM contributed to open source last year
                    - Ecosystem initiative with a number of partners who are launching with us including H2O, RStudio, and Lightbend


·         What software management tools are available?
            - DSX can import Notebooks from GIT HUB

·         What collaboration tools are available?
            - Email Notebook link to colleagues
            - Through GIT HUB
            - Adding Collaborators to projects with 3 roles viz. viewer, editor or admin access [Can we integrate this with their internal LDAP users]

·         How is parallel processing supported?
            - Uses Apache Spark for parallel processing of data

·         Are we able to install other tools as needed?
            - Additional tools can be installed from maven repo (internal or external) as needed
                You can install drivers as needed using the "pip install for python" or "AddJar command in scala"  [Need more clarifications if this is what is expected]
                E.g: To work with Postgres data we need a Postgres JDBCdriver, in scala use %Addjar -f https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download/postgresql-9.4.1207.jre7.jar

·         How similarities or differences are there between DSX and Watson Analytics?
            - Need to research

·         Are we able to run multiple versions of software tools, i.e., Spark?
            - Spark as a service is run on Bluemix Cloud.
                We can run different projects on different Spark Service instances but the Spark version is the one supported by Bluemix. Spark service can be attached at Notebook level
                Currently we support Apache Spark 1.6.[Find out if we can support multiple Spark versions, also find out when is Spark 2.0 scheduled to be supported]

·         What are the mechanisms for transferring data to/from DSX?
            - [Need to find out]

·         What are the options for data storage?  Flat files?  RDBMS?  NoSQL? Hadoop?
               -  Support various databases including RDBMS, NOSQL, Hadoop with Hive(Any format like Parquet, ORC, CSV etc) , Flat files

·         What, if any, responsibilities do we have in terms of system administration?
            - Collaboration of Notebooks
            - Creating connections to different data sources for a project.


·         How are compute instances controlled, i.e, start/stop/monitored?
            - You can start stop a kernel for running the notebooks


·         Integration options with Freddie’s security infrastructure?
            [Need to find out]

·         Available mechanisms for data protection?
            - On Premise data sources use "Secure Gateway"
                Secure connectivity from Bluemix to other applications and data sources running on-premise or in other clouds.
                A remote client is provided to enable secure connectivity.

            - On Cloud data source uses IBM Bluemix secured platform
